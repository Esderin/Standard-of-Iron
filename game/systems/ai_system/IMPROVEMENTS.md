- **behaviors/defend_behavior.cpp** - Unit claiming, tactical targeting
- **behaviors/gather_behavior.cpp** - Unit claiming integration
- **behaviors/production_behavior.{h,cpp}** - Dynamic unit composition strategy

### Build System
- **CMakeLists.txt** - Added new source files

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Command Deduplication (Fixes Jitter)
- **Problem**: Units received redundant commands every 1-2 seconds
- **Solution**: AICommandFilter tracks recent commands with 3s cooldown
- **Impact**: Smooth unit movement, no more stop/start behavior

### 2. Unit Ownership Tracking (Fixes Conflicts)
- **Problem**: Multiple behaviors commanded same units simultaneously
- **Solution**: Priority-based claiming system with lock duration
- **Mechanics**:
  - Behaviors call `claimUnits()` before issuing commands
  - Higher priority can steal units after lock expires
  - Dead units auto-cleaned from assignments
- **Impact**: No more conflicting orders, predictable behavior

### 3. State Machine Hysteresis (Fixes Flipping)
- **Problem**: Rapid state switches at threshold boundaries
- **Solution**: Enter/exit thresholds with gaps
  - Retreat: Enter 25%, Exit 55% (+30% gap)
  - Defend: Enter 40%, Exit 65% (+25% gap)
  - Min state duration: 3 seconds
- **Impact**: Stable decisions, no more indecision loops

### 4. Focus Fire & Tactical Targeting
- **Problem**: Units spread damage, picked random targets
- **Solution**: TacticalUtils::selectFocusFireTarget() with scoring:
  - Target persistence (+10 points) - don't switch constantly
  - Low health bonus (+8-20 points) - finish wounded enemies
  - Unit type priority (archers > melee > workers)
  - Isolation bonus (+6 points) - vulnerable targets
  - Distance penalty - prefer closer targets
- **Impact**: Efficient damage concentration, faster kills

### 5. Engagement Assessment (Fixes Suicide Attacks)
- **Problem**: AI attacked regardless of force ratio
- **Solution**: TacticalUtils::assessEngagement()
  - Calculates force ratio (friendlies/enemies weighted by health)
  - Confidence level: 0.0 = terrible odds, 1.0 = overwhelming
  - Min ratio thresholds: 0.7 attacking, 0.9 defending
- **Impact**: AI won't commit to unwinnable fights

### 6. Intelligent Retreat Behavior
- **Priority**: Critical (overrides everything)
- **Triggers**:
  - Units below 35% health (critical)
  - Units below 50% health AND engaged in combat
- **Action**: Pull back to base in formation
- **Impact**: Preserves army, allows healing/regrouping

### 7. Dynamic Production Strategy
- **Old**: Alternated archer/swordsman blindly
- **New**: Composition based on game phase
  - Early (< 5 units): 70% melee (tanking)
  - Mid (5-12 units): 50/50 balanced
  - Late (12+ units): 60% ranged (DPS)
  - Override: Melee when under threat
- **Impact**: Better army composition for different scenarios

### 8. Enhanced Context Tracking
**New Metrics**:
- `meleeCount` / `rangedCount` - Army composition
- `damagedUnitsCount` - Units below 50% health
- `visibleEnemyCount` - Total visible enemies
- `enemyBuildingsCount` - Enemy structures
- `averageEnemyDistance` - Threat proximity

**Usage**: Enables smarter decision-making

## Behavior Priority Order (Updated)

1. **Critical**: RetreatBehavior - Save damaged units
2. **Critical**: DefendBehavior - Protect base
3. **High**: ProductionBehavior - Build army (concurrent)
4. **Normal**: AttackBehavior - Offensive operations
5. **Low**: GatherBehavior - Rally idle units

## Performance Impact

- **Command Filter**: O(n) per update, < 100 history entries
- **Unit Claiming**: O(1) hash map lookups
- **Tactical Scoring**: O(enemies Ã— attackers) worst case
- **Memory**: +~2KB per AI (tracking structures)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Units don't jitter when idle
- [x] No rapid state flipping
- [x] Attack focuses single target until dead/switching needed
- [x] AI retreats when outnumbered (doesn't suicide)
- [x] Damaged units pull back instead of staying in combat
- [x] Production builds balanced armies
- [x] DefendBehavior doesn't conflict with AttackBehavior
- [x] GatherBehavior gets overridden by higher priority tasks

## Compilation

All files compile cleanly. New dependencies:
- ai_command_filter.cpp
- ai_tactical.cpp
- retreat_behavior.cpp

## Recent Improvements

### 9. Ranged Unit Combat Behavior (Archers)
- **Problem**: Archers continued walking into melee range even when enemies were in firing range
- **Solution**: Enhanced CombatSystem to detect ranged units and stop movement when within attack range
- **Implementation**:
  - Ranged units stop all movement when any enemy is within range, regardless of movement reason
  - Works for archers moving to defend, attack, or any other command
  - Maintain optimal firing distance (85% of max range) when approaching targets during chase
  - Hold position instead of continuing movement when enemies enter effective range
  - Prevents ranged units from walking into melee combat unnecessarily
- **Impact**: Archers now engage from safe distance in all scenarios, maintain tactical advantage

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Advanced Kiting Behavior** - Ranged units actively retreat when enemies close distance
2. **Squad System** - Group units into persistent squads
3. **Threat Map** - Track enemy positions over time
4. **Difficulty Levels** - Configurable reaction times, mistakes
5. **Economic Strategy** - Resource management, expansion timing
