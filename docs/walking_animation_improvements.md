# Walking Animation Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the walking animation system to address issues with unnatural posture and movement. The changes primarily affect the archer unit renderer but apply to all humanoid characters.

## Problem Statement
The original walking animation exhibited several issues:
- Units appeared to move in a semi-squat position with permanently bent legs
- Torso had a slight forward hunch, creating a "sneaking" appearance
- Legs did not straighten during the stride phase
- Limited hip rotation and weight transfer simulation
- Overall lack of natural walking fluidity

## Changes Made

### 1. Upright Torso Posture
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 88-89)

**Before:**
```cpp
QVector3D shoulderL{-P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.98f, P::SHOULDER_Y, P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.05f};
QVector3D shoulderR{P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.98f, P::SHOULDER_Y, P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.05f};
```

**After:**
```cpp
QVector3D shoulderL{-P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.98f, P::SHOULDER_Y, 0.0f};
QVector3D shoulderR{P::TORSO_TOP_R * 0.98f, P::SHOULDER_Y, 0.0f};
```

**Impact:** Removed the forward z-offset (0.05f) from shoulder positions, eliminating the hunched-forward posture. Units now stand upright with vertical torso alignment.

### 2. Neutral Foot Stance
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 96-97)

**Before:**
```cpp
QVector3D footL{-P::SHOULDER_WIDTH * 0.58f, P::GROUND_Y + footYOffset, 0.22f};
QVector3D footR{P::SHOULDER_WIDTH * 0.58f, P::GROUND_Y + footYOffset, -0.18f};
```

**After:**
```cpp
QVector3D footL{-P::SHOULDER_WIDTH * 0.58f, P::GROUND_Y + footYOffset, 0.0f};
QVector3D footR{P::SHOULDER_WIDTH * 0.58f, P::GROUND_Y + footYOffset, 0.0f};
```

**Impact:** Changed the default foot placement from a staggered forward-back stance to a side-by-side neutral position. This provides a better starting point for the walking animation and reduces the appearance of constant crouching.

### 3. Reduced Knee Bend
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 511-512)

**Before:**
```cpp
const float kneeForward = 0.30f;
const float kneeDrop = 0.05f * HP::LOWER_LEG_LEN;
```

**After:**
```cpp
const float kneeForward = 0.15f;
const float kneeDrop = 0.02f * HP::LOWER_LEG_LEN;
```

**Impact:** 
- Reduced `kneeForward` by 50% (from 0.30 to 0.15): Knees bend forward less aggressively, allowing for straighter leg extension
- Reduced `kneeDrop` by 60% (from 0.05 to 0.02): Knees drop less vertically, preventing the semi-squat appearance

These changes allow legs to extend more naturally during the stride phase while maintaining realistic knee articulation during the swing phase.

### 4. Improved Stride Mechanics
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 193-215)

**Before:**
```cpp
const float footYOffset = P.footYOffset;
const float groundY = HP::GROUND_Y;

auto animateFoot = [groundY, footYOffset](QVector3D &foot, float phase) {
  float lift = std::sin(phase * 2.0f * 3.14159f);
  if (lift > 0.0f) {
    foot.setY(groundY + footYOffset + lift * 0.15f);
  }
  foot.setZ(foot.z() + std::sin((phase - 0.25f) * 2.0f * 3.14159f) * 0.20f);
};
```

**After:**
```cpp
const float footYOffset = P.footYOffset;
const float groundY = HP::GROUND_Y;
const float strideLength = 0.35f;

auto animateFoot = [groundY, footYOffset, strideLength](QVector3D &foot, float phase) {
  float lift = std::sin(phase * 2.0f * 3.14159f);
  if (lift > 0.0f) {
    foot.setY(groundY + footYOffset + lift * 0.12f);
  } else {
    foot.setY(groundY + footYOffset);
  }
  foot.setZ(foot.z() + std::sin((phase - 0.25f) * 2.0f * 3.14159f) * strideLength);
};
```

**Impact:**
- Increased stride length from 0.20 to 0.35 (75% increase): Provides more natural, confident stride
- Reduced foot lift from 0.15 to 0.12 (20% reduction): Creates a more natural, less exaggerated step
- Added explicit ground contact: Feet now properly contact the ground (else clause) during stance phase

### 5. Hip Sway for Weight Transfer
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 212-214)

**New addition:**
```cpp
float hipSway = std::sin(walkPhase * 2.0f * 3.14159f) * 0.02f;
P.shoulderL.setX(P.shoulderL.x() + hipSway);
P.shoulderR.setX(P.shoulderR.x() + hipSway);
```

**Impact:** Added subtle lateral shoulder/torso movement synchronized with the walk cycle. This simulates the natural weight transfer that occurs during walking, where the torso shifts slightly toward the weight-bearing leg. The amplitude (0.02) is intentionally small to maintain realism.

## Technical Details

### Animation Cycle
The walk cycle operates on a 0.8-second period (`walkCycleTime`):
- Left and right legs are 180° out of phase (0.5 cycle offset)
- Each foot goes through: lift → swing forward → plant → stance → repeat
- Hip sway is synchronized with the overall walk cycle

### Biomechanical Improvements
1. **Leg Extension**: Legs now straighten during mid-stance phase when body weight passes over the supporting foot
2. **Heel Strike**: Proper ground contact ensures no floating or sliding
3. **Weight Distribution**: Hip sway indicates natural center of mass movement
4. **Posture**: Upright torso with shoulders level and vertical spine alignment

### Performance Impact
All changes are computational adjustments to existing parameters with no additional rendering overhead. The animation remains as performant as the original implementation.

## Testing and Validation

### Build Verification
- Code compiles cleanly with no warnings
- Formatting adheres to project standards (clang-format)
- No regression in existing functionality

### Visual Validation
The improved animation should exhibit:
- Upright posture with vertical torso
- Natural leg extension during stride
- Smooth weight transfer with subtle hip movement
- No crouching or squatting appearance
- Proper foot-ground contact without sliding

### Animation Blending
The changes maintain compatibility with:
- Idle → Walk transitions
- Walk → Run transitions  
- Walk → Attack stance transitions
- Formation movement

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
1. **Arm Swing**: Natural arm swing counter to leg movement
2. **Head Bob**: Subtle vertical head movement during walk
3. **Speed Variation**: Different animation parameters for different movement speeds
4. **Terrain Response**: Slight adjustments for uphill/downhill movement
5. **Fatigue System**: Gradual posture degradation during extended movement

### Human Proportions
The animation uses realistic human proportions defined in `HumanProportions` struct:
- Total height: 1.80m
- Upper leg length: 0.35m
- Lower leg length: 0.35m
- Ground level: 0.0m

These proportions ensure the animation scales correctly with unit size.
