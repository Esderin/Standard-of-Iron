# Archer Shooting Animation Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the archer shooting animation system to address issues with posture, draw tension, and release mechanics. The changes enhance the visual quality and realism of ranged combat.

## Problem Statement
The original shooting animation exhibited several issues:
- Archers appeared hunched or crouched when aiming
- Bow draw was too short (0.35 units) with minimal visible tension
- No distinct release phase or follow-through motion
- Torso remained rigid with no rotation during draw
- Arrow was always visible, even mid-draw
- Minimal recoil or body response after release

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Bow Draw with Proper Tension
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 171-213)

**Before:**
```cpp
QVector3D restPos(0.15f, HP::SHOULDER_Y + 0.15f, 0.20f);
QVector3D drawPos(0.35f, HP::SHOULDER_Y + 0.08f, -0.15f);
```

**After:**
```cpp
QVector3D aimPos(P.bowX + 0.02f, HP::SHOULDER_Y + 0.20f, 0.45f);
QVector3D drawPos(P.bowX + 0.60f, HP::SHOULDER_Y + 0.12f, -0.25f);
QVector3D releasePos(P.bowX + 0.08f, HP::SHOULDER_Y + 0.22f, 0.15f);
```

**Impact:** 
- Draw distance increased from 0.35 to 0.60 units (71% increase)
- Draw pulls back further (-0.25 vs -0.15 in Z-axis) for more visible tension
- Three distinct poses (aim, draw, release) instead of two (rest, draw)

### 2. Improved Animation Phasing
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 174-213)

The animation cycle (1.2 seconds total) now has five distinct phases:

1. **Draw Phase (0.00 - 0.20)**: 20% of cycle
   - Hand moves from aim position to full draw
   - Quadratic easing for smooth acceleration
   - Shoulder rotation begins

2. **Hold Phase (0.20 - 0.50)**: 30% of cycle
   - Hand holds at full draw position
   - Maximum shoulder twist maintained
   - Aiming/targeting window

3. **Release Phase (0.50 - 0.58)**: 8% of cycle
   - Quick snap from draw to release position
   - Cubic easing for explosive release
   - Slight backward head motion (recoil)

4. **Recovery Phase (0.58 - 1.00)**: 42% of cycle
   - Smooth return to aim position
   - Quadratic easing for natural deceleration
   - Shoulder untwists, head returns to center

**Before:**
- Draw: 0.00 - 0.30 (30%)
- Hold: 0.30 - 0.60 (30%)
- Return: 0.60 - 1.00 (40%)

**After:**
- Draw: 0.00 - 0.20 (20%)
- Hold: 0.20 - 0.50 (30%)
- Release: 0.50 - 0.58 (8%)
- Recovery: 0.58 - 1.00 (42%)

### 3. Torso and Shoulder Rotation
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 182-210)

**New Addition:**
```cpp
float shoulderTwist = t * 0.08f;
P.shoulderR.setY(P.shoulderR.y() + shoulderTwist);
P.shoulderL.setY(P.shoulderL.y() - shoulderTwist * 0.5f);
```

**Impact:** 
- Right shoulder rises during draw (up to 0.08 units)
- Left shoulder drops slightly (0.04 units) for counter-rotation
- Creates visible torso twist showing body tension
- Rotation maintained during hold phase
- Gradually returns during recovery

### 4. Recoil and Follow-Through
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 201, 209)

**New Addition:**
```cpp
P.headPos.setZ(P.headPos.z() - t * 0.04f);
```

**Impact:**
- Head pulls back slightly (0.04 units) during release
- Simulates natural recoil response
- Returns smoothly during recovery phase
- Adds weight and impact to the shot

### 5. Arrow Visibility Timing
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 749-769)

**New Addition:**
```cpp
bool showArrow = !isAttacking ||
                 (isAttacking && attackPhase >= 0.0f && attackPhase < 0.52f);

if (showArrow) {
  // Draw arrow shaft, head, and fletching
}
```

**Impact:**
- Arrow disappears at phase 0.52 (just after release at 0.50)
- Syncs with actual projectile spawn timing in combat system
- Prevents visual disconnect between drawn arrow and flying projectile
- Arrow reappears at cycle start (phase 0.0) for next shot

### 6. Attack Phase Calculation
**File:** `render/entity/archer_renderer.cpp` (lines 949-953)

**New Addition:**
```cpp
float attackPhase = 0.0f;
if (isAttacking && !isMelee) {
  float attackCycleTime = 1.2f;
  attackPhase = fmod((p.animationTime + phaseOffset) * (1.0f / attackCycleTime), 1.0f);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Calculates current attack phase for each archer instance
- Passes phase to drawBowAndArrow for arrow visibility control
- Uses same 1.2s cycle time as animation for consistency
- Only calculated for ranged attacks (skips melee mode)

## Technical Details

### Animation Timing
The animation uses a 1.2-second cycle that aligns with the combat system's cooldown:
- **attackCycleTime**: 1.2 seconds
- **Cooldown sync**: Matches combat system ranged attack cooldown
- **Phase calculation**: `fmod(animTime / attackCycleTime, 1.0)`

### Easing Functions
Different easing functions provide natural motion quality:
- **Quadratic (t²)**: Draw and recovery phases - smooth acceleration/deceleration
- **Cubic (t³)**: Release phase - explosive, powerful release
- **Linear**: Hold phase - static aiming

### Body Mechanics
The animation simulates realistic archery biomechanics:
1. **Anchor Point**: Right hand draws to consistent position near face
2. **Bow Arm**: Left hand remains steady at bow grip
3. **Shoulder Rotation**: Right shoulder rises, left drops slightly
4. **Head Position**: Maintains alignment, slight backward lean on release
5. **Weight Distribution**: Implied through shoulder and head movement

### Compatibility
All changes maintain compatibility with:
- **Idle State**: Smooth transition from/to aim position
- **Walking State**: Animation works while moving (stationary check in combat)
- **Formation**: Per-archer phase offset prevents synchronized appearance
- **AI and Player**: Same animation system for all archer units
- **Melee Mode**: Original melee animation untouched

## Performance Impact
All changes are computational adjustments to existing systems:
- No additional draw calls or geometry
- Minimal CPU overhead (few additional vector operations)
- No memory allocation changes
- Same rendering pipeline as before

## Testing and Validation

### Build Verification
- Code compiles cleanly with no warnings
- Formatting adheres to project standards (clang-format)
- No regression in existing functionality

### Visual Quality Checks
The improved animation should exhibit:
- Upright posture with realistic shoulder positioning
- Visible bow tension during full draw
- Natural release motion with slight recoil
- Arrow disappears at correct moment (synced with projectile spawn)
- Smooth transitions between all animation phases
- No jittery or abrupt movements

### Gameplay Integration
- Animation blends seamlessly with idle stance
- Works correctly with movement system (attacks while stationary)
- Compatible with formation positioning
- Functions identically for player and AI archers
- No impact on combat effectiveness or timing

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
1. **Breathing Animation**: Subtle chest movement during hold phase
2. **Wind Compensation**: Arrow angle adjusts based on environmental wind
3. **Fatigue System**: Slower draw speed or shakier aim after many shots
4. **Skill Variation**: Different draw speeds for veteran vs. novice archers
5. **Elevation Adjustment**: Torso lean for uphill/downhill shots
6. **Quiver Interaction**: Arrow visually pulled from quiver before nocking
